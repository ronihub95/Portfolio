Healthcare analytics is where data volume, regulatory pressure, and real human impact collide. During my time at CGI, I worked across large healthcare clients including **Point32Health** and **Cigna**, supporting analytics that influenced claims accuracy, care management, and financial outcomes.

## working with millions of records

Healthcare data is massive and fragmented.

- Processed **5M+ member records** integrating medical, pharmacy, and eligibility data
- Extracted and standardized **10M+ monthly claims records**
- Ensured **99% data completeness** for actuarial and regulatory reporting

Accuracy wasn’t optional — it was mandatory.

## automating ETL validation

Manual ETL validation was slow, error-prone, and expensive.

I built **Python-based ETL validation workflows** for the SCoReT Desktop App:
- Improved review efficiency by **40%**
- Ensured **100% data accuracy**
- Delivered **~$1.1M in annual cost savings**

This was a turning point where automation replaced manual QA at scale.

## analytics that drive financial outcomes

Beyond pipelines, the real value came from insights.

- Performed root cause analysis on **claim denials**, reducing denial rates by **10–15%**
- Delivered **oncology claims analysis** identifying **~$800K in high-cost outliers**
- Accelerated provider reimbursements and care management reviews

## blending BI with data science

For Cigna, I worked at the intersection of BI and predictive analytics.

- Built **logistic regression models** to identify members likely to enroll in new plans
- Integrated **REST APIs** for near real-time Power BI refreshes
- Reduced reporting latency from **daily to hourly**

## collaboration & mentorship

Healthcare analytics is a team sport.

- Partnered with QA, actuarial, and operations teams
- Supported regulatory and rate-filing requirements
- Mentored **2–3 junior analysts**, standardizing SQL and BI best practices

## tools & technologies

- SQL, Oracle
- Informatica
- Python
- Power BI, Tableau
- Excel
- REST APIs
- Jira, ServiceNow, Slack

## takeaway

Healthcare BI isn’t just dashboards — it’s trust, compliance, and precision at scale. When analytics is done right, it saves money, improves care, and keeps systems accountable.
