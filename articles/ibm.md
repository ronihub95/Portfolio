Utilities analytics doesn’t get much spotlight, but it powers critical infrastructure. At IBM, I worked on analytics systems supporting **Oncor Electric Delivery**, processing millions of records from smart meters and operational systems.

## processing data at infrastructure scale

Smart meters generate enormous volumes of data.

- Built **Informatica ETL pipelines** processing millions of AMS records
- Supported OMS, MDMS, and CCB operational systems
- Ensured data consistency across downstream reporting layers

The goal wasn’t just storage — it was usability.

## making big data fast

Large datasets are useless if they’re slow.

By applying:
- Table partitioning
- SQL query optimization
- Unix-based performance tuning

I reduced end-to-end processing time from **~2 hours to ~45 minutes**.

## analytics that recover revenue

One of the most impactful initiatives involved **CCB estimation analysis**.

- Partnered with metering, billing, and BI teams
- Supported **IBM Cognos reporting**
- Contributed to a **multi-million-dollar revenue recovery effort**

Analytics directly influenced business outcomes — not just reports.

## bridging engineering and analytics

This role shaped my transition from ETL developer to analytics professional. I learned how raw operational data becomes trusted insights when engineering and BI work together.

## tools & technologies

- Informatica
- SQL, Oracle
- IBM Cognos
- Unix
- Python

## takeaway

Utilities analytics is about reliability. When systems work quietly and accurately behind the scenes, millions of customers benefit — and the business stays financially healthy.
