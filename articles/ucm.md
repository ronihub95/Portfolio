Working with data in higher education is very different from working in tech or healthcare. The constraints are tighter, the stakeholders are diverse, and the data quality challenges are very real. But when done right, analytics can directly impact engagement, trust, and long-term relationships.

## the problem: messy data and low engagement

At the University of Central Missouri, alumni data lived in a CRM that had grown organically over years. Duplicate records, inconsistent fields, and outdated engagement data made it hard to answer even basic questions like:

- Who are our most engaged alumni?
- Which campaigns actually work?
- Where should advancement teams focus their efforts?

## ensuring data integrity at scale

My first priority was data accuracy.

- Maintained and validated **75K+ alumni CRM records** with **99% accuracy**
- Cleansed and validated **2K+ records weekly** using Excel and CRM rules
- Improved overall data reliability by **~25%**, restoring trust in downstream reporting

Reliable data became the foundation for everything else.

## automating what humans shouldn’t do

Manual imports were eating up hours every week and introducing errors.

I redesigned data import workflows by:
- Creating automated field mappings
- Validating inputs before ingestion
- Eliminating redundant manual steps

This saved **~15 hours per week**, freeing the team to focus on analysis instead of cleanup.

## optimizing engagement with experimentation

Once the data was trustworthy, we could experiment.

Using **predictive segmentation, A/B testing, and Tableau dashboards**, I helped optimize alumni email campaigns. The result?

➡️ **225% lift in click-through rates**

Analytics stopped being reactive and became a strategic tool for engagement and donor prospecting.

## tools & technologies

- Excel
- CRM (Virtuous)
- Tableau
- A/B Testing
- Predictive Modeling

## takeaway

In higher education, analytics isn’t about flashy dashboards. It’s about trust, accuracy, and making sure the right message reaches the right person. When data works quietly in the background, relationships thrive.
